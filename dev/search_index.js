The GPP-threshold is calculated as:\n\nGPP_threshold = quantile(GPPd095)*tGPP\n\nGPPd time series are smoothed with a moving average to avoid fluctuations  in the delineation of the growing season.

For convenience, these arguments can be provided using a DataFrame, however, the result then is not type stable.\n\nDetails\n\nThe two main roughness parameters, the displacement height (d) and the roughness length for momentum (z0m) can be estimated from simple empirical relationships with canopy height (zh). If method = Val(:canopy_height), the following formulas are used:  \n\nd = frac_d * zh\n\nz0m = frac_z0m * zh\n\nwhere frac_d defaults to 0.7 and frac_z0m to 0.1.\n\nAlternatively, d and z0m can be estimated from both canopy height and LAI (If method = Val(:canopy_height_LAI)). Based on data from Shaw & Pereira 1982, Choudhury & Monteith 1988 proposed  the following semi-empirical relations:\n\nX = cd * LAI\n\nd = 11 * zh * ln(1 + X^14) \n\nz0m = hs + 03 * zh * X^12   for 0 = X = 02\n\nz0m = hs * zh * (1 - dzh)   for 02  X \n\nIf method = Val(:wind_profile), z0m is estimated by solving the wind speed profile for z0m:\n\nz0m = median((zr - d) * exp(-k*wind  ustar - psi_m)\n\nBy default, d in this equation is fixed to 0.7*zh, but can be set to any other value.   \n\nValue\n\na NamedTuple with the following components:\n\nd: Zero-plane displacement height (m)\nz0m: Roughness length for momentum (m)\nz0m_se: Only if method = wind_profile: Standard Error of the median for z0m (m)\n\nReferences\n\nChoudhury, B.

In this case, the wind speed at a given height z is given by:\n\nu(z) = (ustark) * (ln((z - d)  z0m) - psi_m\n\nThe roughness parameters zero-plane displacement height (d) and roughness length (z0m) can be approximated from roughness_parameters.  psi_m is the stability correction. Set it to zero (not recommended) to neglect statbility correction. By default it is estimated from wind profile using stability_correction\n\nNote\n\nNote that this equation is only valid for z >= d + z0m, and it is not  meaningful to calculate values closely above d + z0m. All values in heights smaller than d + z0m will return 0. \n\nValue\n\nwind speed at given height z. \n\nReferences\n\nMonteith, JL., Unsworth, MH., 2008: Principles of Environmental Physics. 3rd edition.

For convenience, these arguments can be provided using a DataFrame, however, the result then is not type stable.\n\nDetails\n\nThe two main roughness parameters, the displacement height (d) and the roughness length for momentum (z0m) can be estimated from simple empirical relationships with canopy height (zh). If method = Val(:canopy_height), the following formulas are used:  \n\nd = frac_d * zh\n\nz0m = frac_z0m * zh\n\nwhere frac_d defaults to 0.7 and frac_z0m to 0.1.\n\nAlternatively, d and z0m can be estimated from both canopy height and LAI (If method = Val(:canopy_height_LAI)). Based on data from Shaw & Pereira 1982, Choudhury & Monteith 1988 proposed  the following semi-empirical relations:\n\nX = cd * LAI\n\nd = 11 * zh * ln(1 + X^14) \n\nz0m = hs + 03 * zh * X^12   for 0 = X = 02\n\nz0m = hs * zh * (1 - dzh)   for 02  X \n\nIf method = Val(:wind_profile), z0m is estimated by solving the wind speed profile for z0m:\n\nz0m = median((zr - d) * exp(-k*wind  ustar - psi_m)\n\nBy default, d in this equation is fixed to 0.7*zh, but can be set to any other value.   \n\nValue\n\na NamedTuple with the following components:\n\nd: Zero-plane displacement height (m)\nz0m: Roughness length for momentum (m)\nz0m_se: Only if method = wind_profile: Standard Error of the median for z0m (m)\n\nReferences\n\nChoudhury, B.

All calculations in the Bigleaf.jl package assume that the ecosystem behaves like a  \"big-leaf\", i.e. a single, homogenous plane which acts as the only source and sink of the measured fluxes. This assumption comes with the advantages that calculations are simplified considerably and that (in most cases) little ancillary information on the EC sites is required.
