**Bigleaf.jl** is a partial Julia port of Jürgen Knauer's 
[**bigleaf** R package](https://bitbucket.org/juergenknauer/Bigleaf) 
for the calculation of physical (e.g. aerodynamic conductance, surface temperature) 
and physiological (e.g. canopy conductance, water-use efficiency) ecosystem properties 
from eddy covariance data and accompanying meteorological measurements. 
All calculations are based on a 'big-leaf' representation of the vegetation and 
return representative bulk ecosystem/canopy variables.

## Installation and Loading

The `bigleaf.jl` R package can be installed with the usual command once:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(Bigleaf)
```

And then importet to the every Julia session by:
```julia
using Bigleaf
```

## Usage
See the [Documentation](https://bgctw.github.io/Bigleaf.jl/dev/) 
that includes a [walkthrough](https://bgctw.github.io/Bigleaf.jl/dev/walkthrough/).

## Package content 
We are porting functionality of the [R package](https://bitbucket.org/juergenknauer/Bigleaf) as needed. Please
file an [issue](https://github.com/bgctw/Bigleaf.jl/issues) if you need a specific feature.

At the current state we ported
- Meteorological variables
- Evapotranspiration
- Potential radiation
- Unit conversions
- Filtering data
